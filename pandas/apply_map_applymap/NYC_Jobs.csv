DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâs 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction (BEDC) currently has $4.2B of active construction contracts, $9.4B of design contracts, and another $10.5B of future projects projected in the 10-year commitment plan under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  The Agencyâs Vision is to be the safest, most efficient, cost effective, resilient, and transparent water utility in the nation. In order to carry out the mission of providing high quality, reliable water supply to New York City and some upstate communities, the Department operates a network of watershed wastewater treatment plants, dams, bridges, shafts, reservoirs, tunnels, pumping stations, ultraviolet disinfection systems, filtration systems, and associated facilities throughout New York City and its watershed.

DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees.  DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâs 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction (BEDC) currently has $4.2B of active construction contracts, $9.4B of design contracts, and another $10.5B of future projects projected in the 10-year commitment plan under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.

NYCHAâs Real Estate Development Department (REDD) is charged with leading and structuring real estate transactions that will address over $15 billion in capital needs.  REDD will utilize the following three tools to generate the necessary revenue:  1) Permanent Affordability Commitment Together (PACT) â PACT will use U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 programs to fund renovations and convert public housing (Section 9) apartments to permanently affordable housing.  NYCHA plans to convert 62,000 apartments over 10 years, which will address $12.8 billion of capital needs.  2) Build to Preserve (BTP) â New mixed-income buildings will be constructed on some underutilized spaces across the NYCHA portfolio.  NYCHA expects to address $2 billion in capital need across approximately 10,000 apartments.  3) Transfer to Preserve (TTP) â NYCHA will sell a portion of its estimated 80 million square feet of unused development rights (âair rightsâ) to adjacent privately-owned sites.  TTP will generate $1 billion for capital repairs at adjacent developments.  Under the direction of the Vice President for Real Estate Transactions, the Project Manager will assist with the financial modeling and analysis of housing development projects on property owned by NYCHA, preservation projects to rehabilitate and preserve NYCHA-owned public housing, and other NYCHA Real Estate Development activities.

DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees.  DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâs 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction (BEDC) currently has $4.2B of active construction contracts, $9.4B of design contracts, and another $10.5B of future projects projected in the 10-year commitment plan under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  BEDCâs Wastewater Capital Program (WWCP) staff oversees the design and construction of all capital projects managed on behalf of the Bureau of Wastewater Treatment (BWT). Currently, WWCP manages the capital delivery requirements for BWT. Some of the capital projects delivered include wastewater resource recovery facilities (WRRF) upgrades/state of good repair improvements, CSO abatement projects and pump station rehabilitation.  WWCP consists of a group of project managers and engineers who manage capital projects consistent with BEDCâs project delivery and construction management procedures, with an emphasis on environmental health and safety, scope, schedule, budget, and client service.  BEDC seeks to hire an Administrative Project Manager MIII to be the Deputy Portfolio Managers (PM) overseeing the administration and operation of a significant subset of projects within Wastewater Capital Program directorate in Queens, NY. The Deputy Portfolio Manager will support the PM managing a portfolio of in-City Wastewater Capital Program projects including: main sewage pump replacement at various WRRFs, Huntâs Point WRRF digester and sludge handling equipment, and power distribution system at various WRRFs.   A portfolio typically consists of a dozen large-scale capital projects in various stages of planning, design and construction with an aggregate value of $1 Billion or more. The Deputy PM will manage assigned projects, while also overseeing AM staff managing projects within the same program or project groups.  While assigned projects will change as existing projects are closed out and new projects are initiated, typical assigned projects include time-sensitive work on various consent orders,  structural improvements and upgrades of main sewage pumping, power distribution, solids handling, and process systems at Wastewater Resource Recovery Facilities;  rehabilitation of wastewater pump stations; rehabilitation of docks and resiliency-related improvements.      The Deputy PM will direct the oversight of the planning, design and construction of major capital construction projects for a program that will allow the DEP to meet its wastewater treatment requirements into the future. The selected candidate will be responsible for the achievement of project goals and milestones, ensuring that all prepared schedules, reports, and work products conform to the scope of work. In addition, the Deputy PM will support the preparation, negotiation, and processing of appropriate modifications to Consultant Contract scope, cost, and schedule for successful project completion. The selected candidate must ensure that Environmental Health & Safety is incorporated throughout the project lifecycle and must be focused on client service to the operating bureaus. The selected engineer will be responsible for the implementation of all project delivery procedures and coordination with all the bureau support divisions, such as the Project Controls Group (Schedule & Cost), Permit Resource Division, Sustainability, Contracts Support, etc. The Deputy PM must be capable of quickly recognizing what is required for a major capital construction project and providing the sustained effort necessary to see the project through from conception to completion. The selected candidate will also be responsible for continuous monitoring of key performance indicators with respect to Scope, Schedule, Budget, and other project performance metrics.   Deputy PM will oversee delivery of a major program or group of projects within a portfolio. The selected candidate will also serve as Acting Portfolio Manager in the absence of the Portfolio Manager and will participate in bureau-wide programs/initiatives (e.g., RFP template development, SOP ownership, curriculum development/presentations for PM Training). The Deputy PM will support other initiatives or issue resolution within the portfolio, directorate, or bureau.  The Deputy PM will perform program/project delivery tasks requiring more experience, resolve and keep watch over interrelated issues and schedules, and delegate less complex project management tasks to their AM/project support staff. Deputy PM will ensure close coordination, consistency, and communication within the portfolio. Under the direction of the PM, Deputy PM may serve as the construction lead responsible on portfolio projects in design to ensure constructability and provide recommendations on potential construction methods as well as sequencing. The selected candidate will evaluate and recommend cost-effective alternatives to meet project goals balancing scope, cost, and schedule constraints and may be tasked to deep dive into challenged projects to prevent further slippage or limit monetary exceedances.

DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees.  DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâs 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction (BEDC) currently has $4.2B of active construction contracts, $9.4B of design contracts, and another $10.5B of future projects projected in the 10-year commitment plan under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  BEDCâs Wastewater Capital Program (WWCP) staff oversees the design and construction of all capital projects managed on behalf of the Bureau of Wastewater Treatment (BWT). Currently, WWCP manages the capital delivery requirements for BWT. Some of the capital projects delivered include wastewater resource recovery facilities (WRRF) upgrades/state of good repair improvements, CSO abatement projects and pump station rehabilitation.  WWCP consists of a group of project managers and engineers who manage capital projects consistent with BEDCâs project delivery and construction management procedures, with an emphasis on environmental health and safety, scope, schedule, budget, and client service.

The Deputy PM will manage assigned projects, while also overseeing AM staff managing projects within the same program or project groups.  While assigned projects will change as existing projects are closed out and new projects are initiated, typical assigned projects include time-sensitive work on various consent orders,  structural improvements and upgrades of main sewage pumping, power distribution, solids handling, and process systems at Wastewater Resource Recovery Facilities;  rehabilitation of wastewater pump stations; rehabilitation of docks and resiliency-related improvements.

NYCHAâs mission is to provide quality housing for New Yorkers that is sustainable, inclusive, and safe, while fostering opportunities for economic mobility. NYCHA also administers a citywide Section 8 leased housing program that serves over 200,000 tenants.    Position Summary: The New York City Housing Authority is seeking a Chief Asset & Capital Management Officer (CACMO). This is a new position at NYCHA that would combine the oversight of the existing Real Estate Development Department (REDD) and the Capital Projects Department (CPD).

The CACMO would oversee one of the largest capital programs in the state as well as a historic real estate transaction portfolio.  NYCHAâs Five Year Capital Plan (2020-2024), overseen by CPD, totals approximately $4.5 billion, which is allocated to capital improvement projects for infrastructure improvements, major modernization, other systemic upgrades, repair, and resiliency improvements.

DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees.  DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâs 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction (BEDC) currently has $4.2B of active construction contracts, $9.4B of design contracts, and another $10.5B of future projects projected in the 10-year commitment plan under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  The Agencyâs Vision is to be the safest, most efficient, cost effective, resilient, and transparent water utility in the nation. In order to carry out the mission of providing high quality, reliable water supply to New York City and some upstate communities, the Department operates a network of watershed wastewater treatment plants, dams, bridges, shafts, reservoirs, tunnels, pumping stations, ultraviolet disinfection systems, filtration systems, and associated facilities throughout New York City and its watershed. A substantial multibillion-dollar capital program is required to provide for new infrastructure as well as the reconstruction of existing assets to ensure the integrity, continuity, and high quality of the water supply. The Water System Capital Program (WSCP) provides for the planning, design, construction management, and construction required to support our operating bureaus.
